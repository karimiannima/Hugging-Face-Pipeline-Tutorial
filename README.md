# Hugging-Face-Pipeline-Tutorial
This repository contains a hands-on tutorial demonstrating how to use the Hugging Face Transformers pipeline API for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.  The tutorial is implemented in the Jupyter notebook: Hugginface_pipline.ipynb.
# üìå Overview

The Hugging Face pipeline provides a high-level API to quickly apply state-of-the-art models for:

Text classification (sentiment analysis, topic classification, etc.)

Named entity recognition (NER)

Question answering

Text generation

Masked language modeling

Translation and summarization

This tutorial walks through multiple examples step-by-step, showing how to:

Load pretrained models with a single line of code.

Apply them to text inputs.

Interpret the outputs.

# üìÇ Contents

Introduction: What the pipeline API is and why it simplifies NLP workflows.

Setup: Installing dependencies and preparing the environment.

Examples:

Sentiment analysis

Fill-mask prediction

Text generation

Question answering

Translation and summarization

Custom Models: How to specify model names or load locally fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: Summary and next steps for deeper Hugging Face usage.
