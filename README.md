# Hugging-Face-Pipeline-Tutorial

This repository contains a hands-on tutorial on using the **Hugging Face Transformers `pipeline` API** for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.  

The tutorial is implemented in the Jupyter notebook: **`Hugginface_pipline.ipynb`**.

---

## üìå Overview
The Hugging Face `pipeline` API provides a simple, high-level interface to state-of-the-art models. With just a few lines of code, you can perform tasks such as:

- ‚úÖ Sentiment Analysis  
- ‚úÖ Masked Language Modeling (Fill-Mask)  
- ‚úÖ Text Generation  
- ‚úÖ Question Answering  
- ‚úÖ Translation & Summarization  

This notebook walks you through each of these tasks step-by-step.
